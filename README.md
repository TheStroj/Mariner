# MARINER

MARINER is an Ocean Protocol explorer for Android. It's a submission to the Data Economy Challenge.

MARINER will be uploaded to the Google Play Store shortly.

Meanwhile, the release install file (.apk) can be found here:

The keystore file, keys, aliases and passwords used to create and sign the release install file are edited out of the code. The code can still be used to generate a debug version of the app, otherwise new keystore information needs to be provided.
